# Controller-of-solid-fuel-boiler-and-electric-water-heater-based-on-ESP32U-ESPhome
I needed to make automation to control the operation of a solid fuel boiler with the ability to operate the equipment from a 230 network and a car battery with automatic switching of the power source. And since the water heating boiler is located in the same room as the boiler, I also added it here.
The project is currently in the phase of active development. I would also like to add that anyone can use this project for their own purposes without my responsibility.
